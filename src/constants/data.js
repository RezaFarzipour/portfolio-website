Customers can easily buy and sell gold, top up their wallet, withdraw funds, and even request physical gold withdrawals. On the admin side, the dashboard provides tools for monitoring transaction reports, managing deposits and withdrawals, setting gold prices, and more.

This powerful and user-friendly system ensures a seamless and secure experience for both users and administrators.
